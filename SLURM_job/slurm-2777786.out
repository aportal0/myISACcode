ncks: ERROR attempt to write 0-dimensional input variable rotated_pole to 1-dimensional space in output file
HINT: When using -A (append) option, all appended variables must be the same rank in the input file as in the output file. The ncwa operator is useful at ridding variables of extraneous (size = 1) dimensions. See how at http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncwa
If you wish to completely replace the existing output file definition and values of the variable rotated_pole by those in the input file, then first remove rotated_pole from the output file using, e.g., ncks -x -v rotated_pole. See more on subsetting at http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#sbs
